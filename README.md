### Data Structures Course Design.  
#### 1. Algorithm implementation - Binary Tree.
- Create a binary tree and perform pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal on it.
- Count the number of leaf nodes in the binary tree.
- Preorder/Inorder/Postorder threaded.
- Implement traversal of the preorder/inorder threaded binary tree.
- Display the binary tree.

#### 2. Comprehensive application - Social network visualization
In a social relationship network, a person's attributes include the region, the school at all levels, the workplace, etc. Each person has many friends and can join certain groups according to personal interests and social activities. It is now necessary to design an algorithm that starts from someone in the social network and looks for someone they might know. For example, according to the number of friends and the group of two people, to find out who may be known; to find out the students who may be known through the school situation.
- Display a person's social relationship network through a graphical interface.
- Find people (not their friends) that someone might know and see how they relate to them (the number of friends).
- Sort these people based on the degree of association they may know.
